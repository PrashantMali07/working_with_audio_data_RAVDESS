## Working with RAVDESS Emotional speech audio
Emotional speech dataset [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-speech-audio)

Here, I have pulled data directly from Kaggle using API, Initialize audio files and created dataset having necessary feature for each files. Using `Librosa` accessed audio files & performed different tasks:

* Read and write audio files in different formats (WAV, MP3, WMA etc.).
* Play the sound on your computer.
* Represent the sound as a waveform, and process it: filter, resample, build spectrograms etc.
* Understanding `Spectrogram` and `Mel Spectrogram`
